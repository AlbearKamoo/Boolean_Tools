# Boolean_Tools
A set of Python modules to assist in solving and visualizing Boolean functions.
I had a lot of Boolean algebra and computer architecture classes and it was a pain to do all the truth tables by hand
so I wrote some neat little scripts to help me out. Really cut down the time I spent on my homework!

# Using the Program
To run Boolean Tools simply download the contents of the repo and run the "Boolean Tools.exe" file located in the Boolean Tools folder. The program is very simple to use, and supports a variety of Boolean logic operations. Input a Boolean expression such as 'p->q' and click the "Truth Table" button and the program will display the expression's truth table, along with  minterm and maxterm information.
