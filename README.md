# Boolean_Tools
A set of Python modules to assist in solving and visualizing Boolean functions.
I had a lot of Boolean algebra and computer architecture classes and it was a pain to do all the truth tables by hand
so I wrote some neat little scripts to help me out. Really cut down the time I spent on my homework!
